# Fonts

Most of the fonts here were created by me using Fontstruct, and 
are available as TTF (True Type Fonts) downloads there.

Some of these are just based on those fonts, but adjusted in height
and spacing to look and feel better in an 8x8 tile grid, as needed
for Pulp-based development.

If there is a -7 and a -8 version of one of these, the -8 version has
no headroom at the top of the font, so multiple lines of the text may
look jumbled.  The -7 version will have a free pixel of headroom.

Feel free to use these in any commercial or free project, just be 
sure to give me credit; link back to this repository.  They are 
provided with an MIT license, very similar to the Creative Commons
Attribution license.
